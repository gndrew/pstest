## Connected Audiences

Connected Audiences allows you to target messages to ad hoc subsets of your user base on the fly, without any pre-configuration in Braze. For example, a media app can use Custom Attribute arrays to track every category or TV show that a customer has favorited. Using Connected Audiences, you can connect a custom CMS with Braze and automatically send a push notification or email to anyone who has favorited a show whenever a new episode is released. Read more in [Documentation][12] and on the [Relate blog][13].
