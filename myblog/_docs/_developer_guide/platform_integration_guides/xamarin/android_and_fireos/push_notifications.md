# Push Notifications

See [the Android integration instructions][1] for information on how to integrate push into your Xamarin Android app.  Furthermore, you can look at the [sample application][2] to see how the namespaces change from java to c#.

In particular, look at:

- [Appboy.xml][5] to see how to set up credentials and set up automatic deep link handling
- [AndroidManifest.xml][6] to see how to set permissions for Braze FCM.
