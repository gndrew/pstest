# News Feed

See [the iOS integration instructions][1] for information on how to integrate the News Feed into your Xamarin iOS app.  Furthermore, you can look at the [sample application][2] implementation samples.

Of all the implementation options, the quickest to implement is the Modal, which can be added by doing

```csharp
ABKFeedViewControllerModalContext m = new ABKFeedViewControllerModalContext ();
this.PresentViewController (m, true, null);
```

in your ViewController.
