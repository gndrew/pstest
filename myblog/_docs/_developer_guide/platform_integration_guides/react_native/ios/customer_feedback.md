# Customer Feedback

See [the iOS integration instructions][1] for information on how to integrate the feedback form into your React Native iOS app. Alternatively, the React plugin provides a `launchFeedback` method that will launch a modal feedback element over your application.

You can look at the [sample iOS application][2]  and [sample React Native application][3]  implementation samples.
