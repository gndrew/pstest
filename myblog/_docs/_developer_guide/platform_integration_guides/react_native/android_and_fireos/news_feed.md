# News Feed

Follow [the Android integration instructions][1]. Alternatively, our React plugin does provide a method, `launchNewsFeed`, that will launch a modal News Feed without further integration.

See the [sample Android React application][2] or the [sample native Android application][3] for implementation samples.
