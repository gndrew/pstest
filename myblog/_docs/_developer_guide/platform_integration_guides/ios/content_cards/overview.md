# Content Cards Overview

## When to Use Content Cards

{% include video.html id="4FUPxkIq2xc" align="right" %}

Content Cards typically sit in a feed of sorts (but not necessarily), and help you take advantage of the visual space by incorporating images and graphics that stand out. You can personalize the cards based on user actions, onboard your customers with a checklist, and much more!

### Great Use Cases

- Showcase new content.
- Coordinate with push messages to illustrate a persistent record of promotions.
- Give customers access to promotions without needing push enabled.
- Trigger order confirmations or other personalized communication with your customer.
- Develop and deliver an onboarding schedule.

## Content Cards & Feed

This is what it looks like for your users to open a basic Content Card feed. There are three basic types of cards that can sit in the feed - a Banner Card, a Captioned Content Card, and a Classic Content Card.

{% alert note %}
Content Cards have a maximum size of **2kb** (including images, links, and all content) - exceeding that amount will prevent the card from sending.
