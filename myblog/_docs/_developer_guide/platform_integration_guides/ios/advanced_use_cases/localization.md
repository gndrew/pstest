# Localization

In addition to English, Braze supports several languages for our built-in SDK messages. These pertain to the default messages displayed in applications integrated with Braze, such as places in the app when there are connectivity issues ("Cannot establish network connection. Please try again later.") See below for a full list of messages (strings). If the phone language is set to one of the supported languages, any of the Braze default strings triggered within an integrated application will automatically appear in that language.

If you are looking for a complete list of supported languages you may attribute to your users in their profiles, please see our [User Language List][1].

## Technical Details

For your convenience, our CocoaPod integrates the `.strings` files for the aforementioned languages. Note that each open-sourced UI component has its own `.strings` file. If you do not wish to use one or more of these languages, you can feel free to delete these files from your project.

Optionally, you can also override any of the following Key / String pairs within your app's `Localizable.strings` file much like a CSS override.

## Localization String File Example

```objc
/*News Feed Default Labels*/
"Appboy.feed.done-button.title" = "Done";
"Appboy.feed.no-card.text" = "We have no updates.\nPlease check again later.";
"Appboy.feed.no-connection.title" = "Connection Error";
"Appboy.feed.no-connection.message" = "Cannot establish network connection.\nPlease try again later.";
/* Content Cards Context Labels */
"Appboy.content-cards.done-button.title" = "Done";
"Appboy.content-cards.no-card.text" = "We have no updates.\nPlease check again later.";
"Appboy.content-cards.no-connection.title" = "Connection Error";
"Appboy.content-cards.no-connection.message" = "Cannot establish network connection.\nPlease try again later.";
