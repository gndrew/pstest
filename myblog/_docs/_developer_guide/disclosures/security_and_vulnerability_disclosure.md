# Braze Security Vulnerability Disclosure Policies

Braze understands that nothing is more important to our customers than the security of their data. As part of our ongoing security program, Braze tests for vulnerabilities to the security of its Services and as part of that effort, welcomes independent and responsible researchers in reporting any vulnerabilities that they identify in the Services so that Braze can address and remediate any potential risks to the security of our systems.

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Braze Services, please email security@braze.com with a summary of your discovery. If there are attachments for your discovery, Braze will provide you with a public key to use in order to send them over email.
