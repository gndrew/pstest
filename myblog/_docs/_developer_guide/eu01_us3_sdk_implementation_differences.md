## SDK Implementation
If you are on the EU-01 Instance when integrating any of our SDKs, please point your SDK endpoints to `https://sdk.fra-01.braze.eu`.

Please note, if you have been set up with a custom endpoint your Customer Success Manager will advise you of the correct address. In that instance simply substitute the endpoint address listed above with the custom address supplied.

These instructions apply specifically to the EU-01 Instance, but can be applied to all other Instances so long as the correct endpoints are referenced."
