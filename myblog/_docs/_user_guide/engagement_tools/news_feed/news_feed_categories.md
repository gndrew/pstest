# News Feed Categories

News Feed "Categories" make it possible to integrate multiple instances of the news feed into your application. It's possible to integrate feeds within different windows that only display news feed cards of a certain "category."

Marking a News Feed as being from a specific "category" is not visible to the end user. By default, the Braze News Feed will display cards of all categories, unless a feed is specifically configured in the app code to display specific categories. For more information on the app code configuration, please see our [technical documentation on the matter][2].
