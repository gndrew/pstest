# Restriction

You can also choose to restrict the members of your organization to sign-in with either Google SSO or SAML SSO. In order to enable, go to `Company Settings` > `Security Settings` and select `Restrict Single Sign-On`.

By enabling this option, your company's Braze users will no longer be able to log in using a password, even if they have logged in with a password before.
