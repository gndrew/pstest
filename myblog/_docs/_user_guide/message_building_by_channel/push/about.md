# What are Push Messages?

> Push notifications are wonderful for time-sensitive calls to action, as well as re-engaging users who haven't come into the app in a while. Successful push campaigns drive the user directly to content and demonstrate the value of your application.

## Potential Use Cases

Push Notifications are a great tool for attracting new users and making re-engagement campaigns. Here are some examples of common Push message use cases. 

| Use Case | Explanation |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Initial Onboarding | Until users take the initial steps towards using your app (such as registering an account), their value is severely limited. Use push notifications to urge users to complete these steps so they can begin using your app in full. |
| First Purchases | After users are comfortable using your app, you can use push notifications to help convert them into in-app purchasers. |
| New Features | Push notifications can be effective in notifying disengaged users about new features that might attract them back to your app. |
| Time Sensitive Offers | If you have a clock ticking on an offer, sometimes Push is a great way to let your users know about it before it expires. These messages generally carry a high sense of urgency and are optimal for reminding recently-lapsed users about your app. |

## Push Message Regulations

Because push messages are an intrusive type of messaging, going directly to the user's phone or browser, there are guidelines for sending push messages via apps and sites.

### Mobile Push Regulations for Apps

{% alert important %}
Your push messages must fall within the guidelines of the Apple App Store and Google's Play Store policies, specifically regarding using push messages as advertisements, spam, promotions, and more.

|[We don’t allow apps or ads that mimic or interfere with system functionality, such as notifications or warnings.][10] System-level notifications may only be used for an app’s integral features, such as an airline app that notifies users of special deals, or a game that notifies users of in-game promotions.|
