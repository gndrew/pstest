# Retrieve List of or Query Email Unsubscribes
{% apimethod get %}
/email/unsubscribes
{% endapimethod %}

Users' email subscription status can be updated and retrieved via Braze using a RESTful API. You can use the API to set up bi-directional sync between Braze and other email systems or your own database. All API requests are made over HTTPS.

{% alert important %}
__Looking for the `api_key` parameter?__<br>As of May 2020, Braze has changed how we read API keys to be more secure. Now API keys must be passed as a request header, please see `YOUR_REST_API_KEY` within the __Example Request__ below.<br><br>Braze will continue to support the `api_key` being passed through the request body and URL parameters, but will eventually be sunset. Please update your API calls accordingly.
{% endalert %}

## Request Parameters

You must provide an `end_date`, as well as either an `email` or a `start_date` .

| Parameter | Required | Data Type | Description |
| ----------|-----------| ---------|------ |
| `start_date` | No * | String in YYYY-MM-DD format| Start date of the range to retrieve unsubscribes, must be earlier than end_date. This is treated as midnight in UTC time by the API. |
| `end_date` | No * | String in YYYY-MM-DD format | End date of the range to retrieve unsubscribes. This is treated as midnight in UTC time by the API. |
| `limit` | No | Integer | Optional field to limit the number of results returned. Defaults to 100, maximum is 500. |
| `offset` | No | Integer | Optional beginning point in the list to retrieve from |
| `sort_direction` | No | String | Pass in the value `asc` to sort unsubscribes from oldest to newest. Pass in `desc` to sort from newest to oldest. If sort_direction is not included, the default order is newest to oldest. |
| `email` | No * | String | If provided, we will return whether or not the user has unsubscribed |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3  .reset-td-br-4}

If your date range has more than `limit` number of unsubscribes, you will need to make multiple API calls, each time increasing the `offset` until a call returns either fewer than `limit` or zero results.
