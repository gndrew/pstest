Use the endpoints below to get the subscription state of a user in a subscription group. These groups will be available on the __Subscription Group__ page. The response from this endpoint will include the external ID and either subscribed, unsubscribed, or unknown for the specific subscription group requested in the API call.  This can be used to update the subscription group state in subsequent API calls or to be displayed on a hosted web page.

__Looking for the `api_key` parameter?__<br>As of May 2020, Braze has changed how we read API keys to be more secure. Now API keys must be passed as a request header, please see `YOUR_REST_API_KEY` within the __Example Request__ below.<br><br>Braze will continue to support the `api_key` being passed through the request body and URL parameters, but will eventually be sunset. Please update your API calls accordingly.

## Request Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Data Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `subscription_group_id`  | Yes | String | The `id` of your subscription group. |
| `external_id`  |  Yes* | String | The `external_id` of the user (must include at least one and at most 50 `external_ids`). When both an external_id and email/phone are submitted, only the external_id(s) provided will be applied to the result query. |
| `email` | Yes* | String | The email address of the user. It can be passed as an array of string with a max of 50. Submitting both an email address and phone number (with no external_id) will result in an error |

The recommendation is to provide this in the `E.164 format`. Submitting both an email address and phone number (with no external_id) will result in an error|
