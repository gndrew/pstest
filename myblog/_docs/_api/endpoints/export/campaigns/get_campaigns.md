# Campaigns List Endpoint
{% apimethod get %}
/campaigns/list
{% endapimethod %}

This endpoint allows you to export a list of campaigns, each of which will include its name, Campaign API Identifier, whether it is an API Campaign, and Tags associated with the campaign. The campaigns are returned in groups of 100 sorted by time of creation (oldest to newest by default).

__Looking for the `api_key` parameter?__<br>As of May 2020, Braze has changed how we read API keys to be more secure. Now API keys must be passed as a request header, please see `YOUR_REST_API_KEY` within the __Example Request__ below.<br><br>Braze will continue to support the `api_key` being passed through the request body and URL parameters, but will eventually be sunset. Please update your API calls accordingly.
