__Looking for the `api_key` parameter?__<br>As of May 2020, Braze has changed how we read API keys to be more secure. Now API keys must be passed as a request header, please see `YOUR_REST_API_KEY` within the __Example Request__ below.<br><br>Braze will continue to support the `api_key` being passed through the request body and URL parameters, but will eventually be sunset. Please update your API calls accordingly.
